    "about.description": "The datacat platform is a cross-project research effort by the Department of 'Geodesy and BIM' at the Faculty of Geoinformation at the University of Applied Sciences Dresden (HTW Dresden). The platform aims to provide user- and developer-friendly components for creating and publishing classification systems, object catalogs, and property databases in the context of the BIM methodology.",
    "components.title": "The Components",
    "components.description": "The platform is currently divided into the core components: datacat API, a developer-friendly, self-documenting GraphQL interface for complex queries on the data catalog, and the datacat editor, a browser-based user tool for navigating and editing the data.",
    "methodology.title": "The Methodology",
    "methodology.description": "The core of the development is a data schema closely aligned with established standards such as DIN EN ISO 12006-3 and DIN EN ISO 23387, making it possible to maintain even complex classification systems in the catalog. The API is entirely agnostic regarding the application-specific structure to be implemented in the data catalog.",
    "opensource.title": "Open Source",
    "opensource.description": "datacat is developed as free and open-source software under the GPLv3 license and can be freely used and distributed, including commercially. The source code is hosted on GitHub. Any form of support for the project is welcome."

    "description1": "datacat editor is a web-based, open-source tool for collaboratively developing data catalogs for the construction industry. The source code is available under the GPL v3 license.",
    "description2": "In a data catalog, you can name, describe, and categorize concepts such as actors, activities, building elements, and properties according to function and form. By creating relationships between these concepts, the built environment can be described more precisely.",
    "description3": "The developed dataset is available for retrieval via an API for developers of import/export tools and CAD/BIM plugins. In the future, validation routines will be developed to identify inconsistencies such as unused concepts, potential duplicates, and missing translations in the catalog.",
    "description4": "datacat is developed at the University of Applied Sciences Dresden (HTW Dresden). If you are interested in the project or have questions about the application, please feel free to contact us directly through the details provided below.",

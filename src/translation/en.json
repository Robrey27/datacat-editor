    "about.description": "The datacat platform is a cross-project research effort by the Department of 'Geodesy and BIM' at the Faculty of Geoinformation at the University of Applied Sciences Dresden (HTW Dresden). The platform aims to provide user- and developer-friendly components for the creation and publication of classification systems, object catalogs, and property databases in the context of the BIM methodology.",
    "components.title": "The Components",
    "components.description": "The platform is currently divided into the core components datacat API, a developer-friendly, self-documenting GraphQL interface for complex queries on the data catalog, and the datacat editor, a browser-based user tool for navigating and editing the data.",
    "methodology.title": "The Methodology",
    "methodology.description": "The core of the development is a data schema closely aligned with established standards DIN EN ISO 12006-3 and DIN EN ISO 23387, which should make it possible to maintain even complex classification systems in the catalog. The API is completely agnostic regarding the application-specific structure to be implemented in the data catalog.",
    "opensource.title": "Open Source",

    "description2": "In a data catalog, you can name, describe, and categorize concepts such as actors, activities, building elements, and properties in multiple languages according to their function and form. By creating relationships between these concepts, the built environment can ultimately be described in more detail.",
    "description3": "The developed dataset is available for retrieval via an API for developers of import/export tools and CAD/BIM plugins. In the future, validation routines will be developed to identify inconsistencies such as unused concepts, possible duplicates, and missing translations in the catalog.",
